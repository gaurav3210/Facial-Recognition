# Facial-Recognition
Supervised Machine Learning Model for facial recognition.

TASKS PERFORMED:
Task 1:
#Loading data
The first task is to load the images from data/folder as NumPy array. First manually go through the data, and understand how it is organised.

X should be a NumPy array containing images and y should contain the corresponding labels.

Task 2:
#Analysing data
Visualise the first image of our dataset.

Task 3:
#Feature Extraction
Currently, X is a 3D NumPy array. For each of the 400 images, we have a corresponding 2D matrix storing the pixel values. We will flatten this 2D matrix and use the flattened vector as the feature vector for the image.


Task 4:
#Dimensionality Reduction
#Data Visualisation.
Reshape X into 400xN, where N is the number of features (112x92).
Task 5:
#Speeding up training and reducing memory
#Splitting the dataset
#Standardising the Dataset
#Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
Task 6:
#Make an object of PCA class named pca so that 99% of variance is preserved.
#Testing
Task 7:
#Predictions
